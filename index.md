## About me

I started to get into electronic music in 1999 while walking in a mall and hearing PVD's music blasting, since then I've been an advocate and a fan of various musical genres. I have also been mixing different genres of electronic music including trance since 2010 when I felt that I needed to showcase my music to others. I'm excited to make more mixes and hopefully looking to live mix.
